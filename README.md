# üëã Hi, I'm Vasant Rawat!  

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **command-line wizard**, **Neovim enthusiast**, and **Linux tinkerer**. I love building minimalist tools, automating everything in sight, and crafting the perfect development environment. When I'm not coding, you'll find me obsessing over my Neovim config or trying to convince my friends to switch to a tiling window manager.
